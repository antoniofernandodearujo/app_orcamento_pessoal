## 👀 About the project

The personal budget app is a web application built with the aim of putting into practice the concepts studied during a module of the **complete web** course, from [Udemy], using the Object Oriented paradigm in JavaScript.

The application consists of an expense control divided into 2 parts, where the first part you register the expense, the second part you check all the expenses and you can filter by a specific expense, as the application does not have a back end, the data is stored in the browser's local storage, and retrieved when needed.
